# Celltypist Template
This is a template to use the python celltypist package to annotate celltypes in a Seurat R object. 

It consists of three parts
* Converson of the Seurat object into an .h5ad files
* celltypist mapping of celltypes on a per-cell basis
* Addition of that annotation to the original Seurat object.
